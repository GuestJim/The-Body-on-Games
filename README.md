# The Body on Games
Scripts I have written to process the video and data for The Body on Games YouTube channel

Mostly these files are Windows Batch scripts for controlling FFmpeg but there is also an R script example for processing the data I collect into a graph and table with the time in the video.

I cannot and will not claim these are the most efficient scripts for what I want to do, but they work and seem appropriate for my first GitHub repository.
